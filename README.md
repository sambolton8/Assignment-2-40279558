ws.py is the Flask file used.

In the templates folder only 'index.html' and 'menu.html' are used. The others can be ignored.
In the css folder 'theme.css' is the only theme used. The others can be ignored.

I have left everything else in to preserve the integrity of the folders. (I don't wanna mess things up...)

Thanks!
